### Meow in the System

Meow. Welcome. Who am I? I'm a typical human who was dissatisfied by my day job. Conveniently, companies are willing to pay software engineers boatloads of money, and I've got practice living cheap and saving money. So! I saved up money and quit, haha! Originally, I told myself I was taking a year off to travel, which I did. I went to Singapore, London, France, Belize, Alaska, and Washington D.C. with family or alone. I went all over, and then it was time to get a job again...but I did not want that life. I made the decision to invest in myself instead of investing myself in a company's agenda. I'm using some of my savings to take another year off to create. My goals are to finish one book (Madrigal of Misfortune!), produce one song, and keep painting and drawing.
