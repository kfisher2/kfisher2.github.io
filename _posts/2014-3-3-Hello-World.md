###Hello! Misfortune abounds!

I'm a person, just like you. **Writing a book!** Perhaps just like you but more likely not. 

In this blog, I will discuss writing challenges I face, share short lore, and release information about my book: **Madrigal of Misfortune** (Mad of Mis).

Mad of Mis is a fantasy novel I started in January 2019 totalling 15,000 words right now. Characters are developing! Plots are unfolding! Questions are waiting for answers! Magical explosions! Kittens! Politics!

This is just the beginning of a long journey! Expected completion is 2022. Feel free to contact me at madrigalofmisfortune@gmail.com.
